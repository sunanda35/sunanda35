## 🧿 Who Am I?

I work best where things get complex —  
high-throughput queues, multi-service workflows, cloud architecture, and systems where one tiny mistake can wake you up at 3AM.

If something needs to scale, self-heal, or survive production chaos —  
that’s usually where I step in.

I build things that scale, tolerate failure, self-heal, and still look so elegant, just like a WOW.😏

### 🧩 Engineering Philosophy

> *“Systems fail.  
Great engineers design architectures that expect failure and still deliver.”*

* `Reliability`  > `Shiny Tools`
* `Performance`  > `Hype`
* `Architecture` > `Chaos`
* `Clarity`      > `Cleverness`

I believe in `idempotency`, `observability`, `retry logic`, `queues`, `caching`, `infra clarity`, and `clean boundaries`.

Everything else is just flavor.
